# 1. Brief Summary of the Project (Purpose & Problem Statement)
This project is an AI-based flood detection and early warning mobile application designed to help communities in Malaysia prepare for and respond to flood disasters. Floods occur frequently in Malaysia, particularly during the monsoon season, causing loss of lives, injuries, property damage, and mass displacement. Current warning systems from agencies such as the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) and the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) often lack real-time, personalized alerts, leading to delayed evacuations and heightened public safety risks. This application addresses these gaps by providing location-based, AI-driven flood alerts.

# 2. Evidence / Real-World Support for the Problem
Malaysia experiences floods almost every year, especially during the monsoon season. Past flood events have resulted in loss of lives, injuries, damaged homes, and thousands of people being evacuated. Many victims reported that they were not prepared because warnings were late or unclear. These real cases show that the current flood warning methods are not enough and that a smarter, faster system is needed to protect people and reduce flood impacts.

# 3. What the App Can Do (Solution)
The mobile app uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze weather data, rainfall information, and past flood records. Based on this data, the app can predict flood risks, show flood-prone areas on a map, and send early warning notifications to users. This helps users take early action, such as preparing supplies or evacuating before the situation becomes dangerous.

# 4. How the Project Aligns with AI
AI is used in this project to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately. Instead of relying only on manual updates, AI can detect flood patterns and predict risks earlier. This makes the system more efficient, reliable, and able to improve over time, helping users receive timely and accurate flood information.

# 5. How the Project Aligns with SDGs
This project supports SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities by improving disaster preparedness and making communities safer. It also supports SDG 13: Climate Action by addressing climate-related disasters such as floods and helping people adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change.
