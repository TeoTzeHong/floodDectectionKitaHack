# 1. Brief Summary of the Project (Purpose & Problem Statement)
This project is an AI-based flood detection and early warning mobile application designed to help communities in Malaysia prepare for and respond to flood disasters. Floods occur frequently in Malaysia, particularly during the monsoon season, causing loss of lives, injuries, property damage, and mass displacement. Current warning systems from agencies such as the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) and the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) often lack real-time, personalized alerts, leading to delayed evacuations and heightened public safety risks. This application addresses these gaps by providing location-based, AI-driven flood alerts.

# 2. Evidence / Real-World Support for the Problem
Malaysia experiences floods almost every year, especially during the monsoon season. Past flood events have resulted in loss of lives, injuries, damaged homes, and thousands of people being evacuated. Many victims reported that they were not prepared because warnings were late or unclear. These real cases show that the current flood warning methods are not enough and that a smarter, faster system is needed to protect people and reduce flood impacts.
