# floodDectection

1. Brief Summary of the Project (Purpose & Problem Statement)
This project is an AI-based flood detection and early warning mobile application designed to help communities in Malaysia prepare for and respond to flood disasters. Floods occur frequently in Malaysia, particularly during the monsoon season, causing loss of lives, injuries, property damage, and mass displacement. Current warning systems from agencies such as the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) and the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) often lack real-time, personalized alerts, leading to delayed evacuations and heightened public safety risks. This application addresses these gaps by providing location-based, AI-driven flood alerts.
